HW# 8 LIRI Bot
Overview

In this assignment, we were asked to create LIRI, a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Requirements:
* Include package.json (this is initialized by running npm init).
* Include .gitignore file.
* Export twitter keys in keys.js file using consumer key/secret and access token key/secret (see Twitter API and Spotify API package documentation).
* The following commands which should be included in the liri.js file should be available to be called in the CLI:
    * my-tweets (shows last 20 tweets)
    * spotify-this-song (shows Artist, Song Name, Preview link and Album)
    * movie-this (shows Movie title, Year, IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, Country, Language, Plot and Actors)
    * do-what-it-says (using the fs node package, this command will call one of LIRI's commands)
* Log output data from called commands to log.txt file.
